We recommend setting up an icon for your user profile.

### Response Hours for Discord Support by Shiguredo Members and Administrators

Shiguredo members and administrators provide Discord support during our business hours:
Monday through Friday from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM.
When a 👀 reaction appears, it indicates that the message has been acknowledged. Please take your time waiting for a response.

### Support for Sora SDKs and Tools

Support for Sora SDKs and tools is available only if you are currently using Sora.
Therefore, please always specify your Sora version when asking questions.

If you are unsure about your Sora version, please first confirm this with your contract administrator before contacting us.

## Development Process

While Shiguredo's open source software has open source code, its development process is not publicly accessible.
As a result, we will close any Issues or Pull Requests submitted without prior discussion on Discord without comment.

  Please first consult with us on Discord if you have any questions or concerns.
