## Development Policies

While Shiguredo's open source software has open source code, its development process is not open.
Therefore, Issue reports or Pull Requests submitted without prior discussion on Discord will be closed without comment.

For any inquiries, please first consult with us via Discord.

### Development Style Inspired by Lua

[Lua is open-source software that has never been developed openly](https://medium.com/@voluntas/lua-%E3%81%AF%E3%82%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%97%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BD%E3%83%95%E3%83%88%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A2%E3%81%A0%E3%81%8C-%E3%82%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%97%E3%83%B3%E9%96%8B%E7%99%BA%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%81%9F%E3%81%93%E3%81%A8%E3%81%AF%E4%B8%80%E5%BA%A6%E3%82%82%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84-61ea83ef96f7)
